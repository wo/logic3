TODO:

- replace 'definability' by 'expressibility', so that we don't get confused about functions being ``defined by composition'' etc.

- use `computable' as a formal concept. I don't remember how I introduce this in ch.5. In later chapters, I assume it is informal, and `recursive' is the formal concept. It's better to use `computable' for the formal concept and say in ch.5 that the concept will be formally defined in the following ch.s.

- give simple derivations of Gödel's and Church's Theorems from Tarski's, as in the lecture notes, using the Church-Turing thesis.
